# Competitive Calculator

This is a small calculator designed for estimating the computational complexity of a problem during programming competitions.

For example, you might need to quickly calculate 2¬≤‚Å∞‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄC‚ÇÖ. 

Just create a new line and type:
```
2^20*10C5
```
Now hit `Cmd+Alt+c` on macOS or `Ctrl+Alt+c` on Windows and bang! The result will immediately be shown like this üëá
```
2^20*10C5 = 264,241,152
```
