# compcalc

This is a small calculator for estimating the computational complexity of a problem during programming competitions.

For example, you might need to quickly calculate $2^{20}  {}_{10}\mathrm{C}_{5}$. In that case, you can just type 

```
2^20*10C5
```
into a new line and hit calculate from command palette. The result will be ðŸ‘‡
```
2^20*10C5 = 264,241,152
```
